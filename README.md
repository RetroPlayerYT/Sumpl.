# Sumpl.

Custom HTML, simple and minimalistic.

----------------------

# How to install
There is a Codepen of the app.  [Open it here.](https://codepen.io/rodrigo-oliveira-the-scripter/pen/MWJwqrp)

Now, to get started, add this to your head tag: ```<link href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/RetroPlayerYT/Sumpl./main/Sumpl.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">``` or clone this repository by typing this on your terminal/cmd: `git clone https://github.com/RetroPlayerYT/Sumpl..git`.

If you cloned the repository, add this to your head tag: ```<link href="Sumpl/Sumpl.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">```

Finally, you can get started!

We will start up with a regular button. To do that, let's type on our body tag: ```<button class="sumpl-button">Text here.</button>```
It will look like this: ![https://i.imgur.com/LIALWEZ.png](Regular Button)

Now, let's customize our buttons.
Let's add colors to it. You can add Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and even Lime!

You just need to add to the `sumpl-button` class `-(color)` at the end of the class! ![https://i.imgur.com/tHSj3dr.png](Colored Buttons)

Let's now make the buttons larger!

At the end of our class, (example: `sumpl-button-lime`) lets add `-large`!

It will look like this: ![https://i.imgur.com/41meofD.png](Large buttons)

The button class works for inputs (working on input class) and for links (href).
